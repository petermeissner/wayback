Description: Make sure packages are available at runtime without any setup. 
    Package installation, reproducability and exchanging code can be 
    frunstrating especially if code is used on older R versions. 
    Often it is hard puzzle out which package versions are able to work 
    together after some years have passed and packages evolved further and 
    further. The `wayback` package aims to make this process as painless 
    and robust as possible by using `MRAN`'s `CRAN` snapshots to build local
    package libraries from way back.
